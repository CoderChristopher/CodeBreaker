# CodeBreaker
This is a simple game written in Javascript with the Vue3 Framework where one must break the code given using mathematical clues.

# Rules
The code is initalized a 0-0-0-0.
+ To the left of a 'code-wheel' a indicator may be given of a property of the correct number for the wheel.
+ The '-' indicates that the wheel is even.
+ The 'p' indicates that the wheel is prime.
+ To the right of the wheels is a number that indicates the number of correct digits across all the wheels. This however does not indicate if the digits are in the correct order.
+ The number will be green if the sum of the wheels is equal to the sum of the correct digits, otherwise the number will be red.
+ To increase the value of a given wheel left click on it.
+ To decrease the value of a given wheel right click on it.

# Development/Rational
This project was put together in an evening and is part of my endevors to teach myself Vue3 for Javascript. I find games are a wonderful way to facilitate learning of new programming languages because often they force you to use multiple different concepts at the same time and there is a definitive goal of which to strive for. Also once you are done with the project you hopefully have something 'fun' to show someone else.
